# RBACPolicy CRD

### **What is the RBACPolicy CRD?**

The RBACPolicy CRD, introduced by rbac-manager, allows you to grant and deny access to Kubernetes resources, fostering the principle of least privilege and enhancing the security posture of your clusters.

### **Key Features and Concepts**

#### **Preset Roles**

* RBACPolicy CRD simplifies RBAC management by offering a selection of preset roles. Administrators can quickly assign permissions using predefined roles for common use cases without the need for extensive custom configurations. For information on supported preset roles, please refer to the documentation for the respective preset roles.
